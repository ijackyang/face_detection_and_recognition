# face_detection_and_recognition
end-to-end face detection and recognition training based on faster RCNN.

This project's code is based on the mask-rcnn: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN.
But the mask prediction part is removed, but I add the spatial network and the face recognition part. Further demonstration will be added to this repository.
